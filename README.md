# MyTube Discord Bot
MyTube is a simple Discord bot that allows users to stream YouTube videos in their voice channels.

How to stream an audio in 2 steps:</br>
1. `/join` to make the bot join in a vc you are in.
2. `/addsong [youtube_url]` to add songs. Youtube playlists also work and recommended. Make sure they are not private in order for the bot to recognize.

Functionality for audio player actions such as skipping and shuffling is currently under experimentation and these are the only commands supported:</br>
`/skip` to skip the current music playing.</br>
`/playpause` to toggle Play/Pause in the track.</br>
